# Thumbs: Instant, Accurate Feedback

## Overview
This was my personal project at DevMountain (about week 8 of the program). I had observed that often instructors checked for student understanding only to get less than perfect information. (For example, "How are you feeling about closures? Thumbs up is great, sideways is so-so, and down is completely lost.") Despite being completely lost, some brave souls offered a solid "thumbs up", spurring the lecture onward when in reality, hearing about lexical environment a second time would have benefited  to everyone. Maybe they didn't want to look dumb. Maybe they didn't want to make an instructor feel bad. Either way, making the response to these type of "check point" questions anonymous seemed to solve a problem. And, it's not like DevMountain is the only place this happens. People are asking for different forms of feedback all over the world, every day. **Thumbs is a little tool to help out when anonymity in feedback-seeking is helpful.**
